# Introduction

This report provides an analysis of the admissions data to identify key factors influencing admissions decisions. The goal is to generate actionable insights for institutional leadership to support strategic decision-making.

## Objectives

-   Understand the distribution of admissions decisions across states.
-   Analyze the impact of GPA, test scores, work experience, and volunteer levels on admissions.
-   Provide actionable recommendations based on data-driven insights.

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(ggplot2)
library(readr)
library(dplyr)
library(ggcorrplot)

# Load the data
data <- read_csv('SummerStudentAdmissions2.csv')

```

```{r}
# Initial data check
head(data)
```

```{r}
summary(data)
```

## Data Cleaning

```{r data-cleaning}
# Remove invalid 'Decision' values
valid_decisions <- c('Admit', 'Decline', 'Waitlist')
data <- data %>% filter(Decision %in% valid_decisions)

# Replace invalid gender values (-1.0) with NA
data$Gender <- ifelse(data$Gender == -1, NA, data$Gender)

# Handle missing values
data <- data %>% drop_na()

# Check cleaned data
summary(data)
```

## Visualizations and Analysis

### 1. Admission Rates by State

```{r admission-rates-by-state}
ggplot(data, aes(x = State, fill = Decision)) +
  geom_bar(position = 'fill') +
  labs(title = 'Admission Rates by State', y = 'Proportion', x = 'State') +
  theme_minimal()
```

**Analysis:** The visualization highlights which states have higher or lower admission rates. States with consistently low acceptance rates may need targeted recruitment strategies or support programs.

### 2. GPA and Test Scores for Admitted vs. Rejected Students

```{r gpa-testscore-distribution}
ggplot(data, aes(x = GPA, y = TestScore, color = Decision)) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(title = 'GPA vs. Test Scores by Admission Decision', x = 'GPA', y = 'Test Score') +
  theme_minimal()
```

**Analysis:** This scatter plot reveals how GPA and test scores correlate with admissions decisions. Students with higher GPAs and test scores generally have a higher chance of being admitted.

### 3. Correlation Heatmap

```{r correlation-heatmap}
corr_matrix <- data %>% select(GPA, WorkExp, TestScore, WritingScore, VolunteerLevel) %>% cor()
ggcorrplot(corr_matrix, lab = TRUE, title = 'Correlation Matrix')
```

**Analysis:** The heatmap shows the correlations between quantitative variables. Strong correlations can help identify which metrics are most predictive of admissions success.

### 4. Grouped boxplot

**Analysis:** This grouped boxplot provides insights into the distribution of admissions criteria.

Key observations include:

-   GPA/ and Admission Relationship: The visualization confirms that applicants with a GPA above a certain threshold (e.g., 3.5) have a significantly higher chance of admission.

-   Test score and Admission Relationship: A sharp increase in acceptance rates is observed in the 900-1000 test score range

-   High writing scores (90-100) improve chances for getting admission

-   Volunteer Experience Impact: it appears to have minimal impact on the final admission decision

## Conclusion

### GPA Impact

1.  High GPAs (3.0-3.5 and 3.5-4.0) have significantly higher acceptance rates, with the 3.5-4.0 range being the strongest predictor of acceptance.
2.  Suggests that academic performance is a critical factor in the admission process.

### Test Scores

1.  A sharp increase in acceptance rates is observed in the 900-1000 test score range.
2.  Emphasizes the importance of standardized testing in the selection process.

### Writing Scores

1.  High writing scores (90-100) improve acceptance chances, but the acceptance rate is still significantly lower compared to other metrics.
2.  Indicates writing score might be a secondary factor or less emphasized compared to GPA and test scores.

### Work Experience

1.  Applicants with less work experience (0-20 years) show higher acceptance rates.
2.  This might indicate a preference for younger applicants or those earlier in their career paths, possibly aligning with program goals targeting recent graduates or early-career professionals.

### Volunteer Level

1.  Volunteer levels do not show a strong correlation with acceptance rates, suggesting this might not be a significant criterion in the current evaluation process.

### Applicant’s Stat

1.  There is a notable geographical impact on acceptance rates, with California having the highest acceptance rate.
2.  States like Alabama, Vermont, and Virginia also show strong acceptance metrics, while other states may need more targeted outreach or support.

## Suggestions for Future Admission Evaluations:

1.  Enhance GPA Weighting: • Maintain or increase the emphasis on academic performance, particularly for applicants with GPAs above 3.0. • Consider adding additional weight to applicants from rigorous academic institutions or challenging coursework.

2.  Reevaluate Work Experience Criteria: • Consider whether the preference for less work experience aligns with program goals. If diversity in professional backgrounds is desired, adjust admission strategies accordingly.

3.  Writing Skills Assessment: • If writing is a critical skill for success in the program, enhance the evaluation of writing samples or essays. Alternatively, if writing scores are not as crucial, streamline this criterion to focus on higher-impact factors.

4.  Volunteer Experience Consideration: • Since volunteer experience does not show a strong influence on acceptance rates, consider de-emphasizing this criterion unless community service is a core value of the institution.

## Marketing Campaign Suggestions:

1.  Target High-Performing Students
    -   Focus outreach efforts on students with high GPAs and strong standardized test scores.
    -   Collaborate with high schools, undergraduate institutions, and tutoring centers to attract these candidates.
2.  Regional Campaigns
    -   Implement targeted marketing in high-acceptance regions such as California, Virginia, and Vermont.
    -   For states with lower acceptance rates, explore potential barriers (e.g., awareness, application support) and address them through localized campaigns.

## Overall Strategy

1.  By focusing on academic excellence and regional strengths, while adjusting evaluation criteria to align with institutional priorities, the admissions team can enhance both the quality and diversity of incoming students.
2.  Simultaneously, targeted and data-driven marketing efforts will ensure that the institution attracts well-qualified applicants and improves overall admission outcomes.
